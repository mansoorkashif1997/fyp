The primary aim of this research is to evaluate the performance of various supervised machine
learning models in detecting credit card fraud in highly imbalanced data. Specific objectives
include:
● To preprocess the dataset and apply appropriate resampling techniques.

● To build and compare different predictive models.

● To assess model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

● To analyze the trade-offs between model complexity, interpretability, and performance.
